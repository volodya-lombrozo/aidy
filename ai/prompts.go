Generate a title message based on the provided diffs. Review the list of changes and diffs that will be sent to GitHub.
Carefully review the diffs and generate a one-line title message for those changes.
The title should be structured as follows: <type>(#%s): <description>
Use the following options for <type>: fix, feat, build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, perf, test.
Additionally, you can extract the issue number from the current branch name.
Ensure the title message:
- Starts with the appropriate prefix.
- Includes an issue number.
- Is in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adding feature").
- Does not exceed 72 characters.
Reply only with the one-line title, without any additional text, explanations, or line breaks.`
